### Welcome ! You will find here some illustrations of my work as a PhD student at CEA Saclay ! I am working on simulation and modelisation of nuclear glasses and using a Lattice Boltzmann Method, which can be used for a very wide panel of application.

First video : Directional solidification. 
A cosinusoidal interface is initialized between a solid phase and a liquid phase. A temperature gradient is imposed, graduating from a cold temperature at the bottom to a hotter one at the top of the domain.
The solidification is dominated by the atomic diffusion of the liquid molecule to the solid interface. The phenomenon is accelerated at higher temperature which lead to a dendritic growth.

Second video : Ostwald Ripening for a ternary glass with thermodynamic values.
A random number of droplet is initialized at random positions. There are three components in this model of ternary nuclear glass, Na2O, SiO2 and MoO3. The composition in each phases are initialized close the the equilibrum. We can see that smaller droplet disappear in time, and the composition is rearranging itself to attend equilibrum by crossing interface of bigger droplets. This phenomenon is linked to the chemical potential of each phases that induced a flux from small to big droplet until the equilibrum is reached, leading to a similar chemical potential in the whole domain.

Third video : Falling droplet.
A sphere is intialized with a different density than the surrounding fluid. Due to the gravity, the droplet is sedimenting.
